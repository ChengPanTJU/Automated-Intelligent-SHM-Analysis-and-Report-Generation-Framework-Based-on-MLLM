# Automated-Intelligent-SHM-Analysis-and-Report-Generation-Framework-Based-on-MLLM
This study proposes an automated method for generating SHM assessment reports based on multimodal large language models (MLLMs), and releases the corresponding code.

Usage: 
Open the config.py file, configure the necessary computational parameters and file parameter information, then run Auto_analysis_main.py.

To demonstrate the results, we uploaded a PDF file containing the complete generated report for Case Study 1 in the paper. All figures and tables were automatically generated and inserted, and the highlighted text is the result automatically generated by MLLM.
